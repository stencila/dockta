The example is based on the tutorial [Geocoding in R by Claudia Engel](http://www.rpubs.com/cengel248/97543])

There is a number of packages needed to do the geocoding analysis from the tutorial. 
These packages are commonly used in the geocoding community but require installation before the 
first use and updates further on. They are also unlikely to be available on cloud services providing 
access to R (such as R Studio Cloud). This means that anyone who would like to go through this 
tutorial hands-on has to deal with installting and setting up the packages.

Dockter can help with that by running through this RMarkdown file and checking for packages that 
need to be loaded, and from there creating relevant meta-data files allowing for building and 
running Docker containers which would include all that the user needs to run the analysis.

The package `rgdal` [requires two libraries to be installed within the system](https://gist.github.com/dncgst/111b74066eaea87c92cdc5211949cd1e). Dockter will check these dependencies and make sure that they will be included in the `.Dockerfile` which it will create. This means that the
