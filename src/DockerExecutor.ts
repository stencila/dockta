/**
 * Executes a Docker environment.
 *
 * This class has a single method, `execute`, which starts a container from an
 * image and runs the command specified in the Dockerfile `CMD` instruction.
 *
 * It mounts the project's directory into the container a `/work` and uses it
 * as the working directory.
 *
 * It also sets the current user and group as the
 * user and group in the container. This means that within the container the
 * command that runs has the same permissions as the current user does in the
 * `/work` directory.
 *
 * Finally, it removes the container (but not the image).
 *
 * This then is the equivalent of running the container with Docker from within
 * the project directory using,
 *
 *     docker run --rm --volume $(pwd):/work --workdir=/work --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) <image>
