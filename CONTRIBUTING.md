# General contribution guidelines

[Stencila][stencila-site] is an open-source community-driven project. We encourage
and welcome contributions from all community members.

These are mostly guidelines, not rules.
Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

If you are comfortable with Git and GitHub, you can submit a pull request (PR). In Stencila we follow a commonly used workflow
for [contributing to open source projects][how-contribute] (see also [GitHub instructions][github-flow]).

If you have specific suggestions or have found a bug, please [create an issue](https://github.com/stencila/dockta/issues/new).

If you don't want to use GitHub, please tell us what you think on [our chat](https://gitter.im/stencila/stencila) on Gitter or have your say on our
our [Community Forum](https://community.stenci.la/).

## Development

### Getting started

### Development environment

Dockta is implemented as a `Node.js` package in order to make it easier to integrate with other Stencila components written also in this language.
Therefore, in order to develop Dockta you need to have `Node.js` installed on your machine, along with `npm`.
The core of the source code of Dockta is written using [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) which is then compiled into JavaScript.

To get started,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stencila/dockta
cd dockta
npm install
```

To run the CLI during development use, `npm run cli -- <args>` e.g.

```bash
npm run cli -- compile tests/fixtures/dockerfile-date/Dockerfile
```

This uses `ts-node` to compile and run Typescript on the fly so that you don't need to do a build step first.

You might also want to create an alias for convieience during development:

```bash
alias dockta="npm run cli --"
```

## Architecture

Dockta implements a compiler design pattern. Source files are _parsed_ into a `SoftwareEnvironment` instance (the equivalent of an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) in other programming language compilers) which is then used to generate a `Dockerfile` which is then built into a Docker image.

The parser classes e.g. `PythonParser`, `RParser` scan for relevant source files and generate `SoftwareEnvironment` instances.
The generator classes e.g. `PythonGenerator`, `RGenerator` generates a `Dockerfile` for a given `SoftwareEnvironment`.
`DockerGenerator` is a super-generator which combines the other generators.
`DockerBuilder` class builds
`DockerCompiler` links all of these together.

For example, if a folder has single file in it `code.py`, `PythonParser` will parse that file and create a `SoftwareEnvironment` instance, which `DockerGenerator` uses to generate a `Dockerfile`, which `DockerBuilder` uses to build a Docker image.

### Linting and testing

Please check that your changes pass linting and unit tests,

```bash
npm run lint # or, make lint
npm test # or, make text
```

Use `npm test -- <test file path>` to run a single test file.

You can setup a Git pre-commit hook to perform these checks automatically before each commit using `make hooks`.

You can check that any changes you've made are covered üèÖ by unit tests using,

```bash
npm run cover # or, make cover
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

### Documentation generation

If you've been working on in-code documentation üôè you can check that by building and viewing the docs,

```bash
npm run docs # or, make docs
open docs/index.html
```

### Contributors list

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification. Please add contribuors, including yourself, using,

```bash
# Add new contributor <username>, who made a contribution of type <contribution>
npm run contributors:add <username> <contribution>
# Example:
npm run contributors:add octocat code,doc
# Regenerate the readme table
npm run contributors:generate
```

See the list of contribution codes [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/all-contributors-cli#addupdate-contributors).

### Commit messages

Please use [conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) style commit messages e.g. `docs(readme): fixed spelling mistake`. See [the specifications](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) for full details. This help with automated semantic versioning.
To make this easier, [Commitzen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) is a development dependency and can be used via `npm` or `make`:

```bash
npm run commit # or, make commit
```

### Continuous integration

Linting, test coverage, binary builds, package builds, and documentation generation are done on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/stencila/dockta). [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) is enabled to automate version management: minor version releases are done if any `feat(...)` commits are pushed, patch version releases are done if any `fix(...)` commits are pushed. Releases are made to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stencila/dockta) and [Github Releases](https://github.com/stencila/dockta/releases).

### Python System Dependencies

We maintain a list of system packages (e.g `deb`/`rpm`) that a Python packages installed through `pip` might need to include. These are in the file `PythonSystemDependencies.json`.
If you find a Python package that relies on a system library you can add the lookup to this file; the mapping is in the format `lookup[pythonPackageName][pythonVersion(str)][packagingType][osVersion]`. The `"default"` can be used as a fallback at any level. For example:

- `["pypackage"]["2"]["deb"]["trusty"] = ["some-deb-package"]`
- `["otherpypackage"]["3"]["rpm"]["default"] = ["some-rpm-package"]`
- `["thirdpypackage"]["default"]["default"]["default"] = ["some-consistent-package", "some-other-package"]`

### Using the router and server

The [Express](https://expressjs.com) router provides `PUT /compile` and `PUT /execute` endpoints (which do the same thing as the corresponding CLI commands). You can serve them using,

```bash
npm start
```

Or, during development using,

```bash
npm run server
```

A minimal example of how to integrate the router into your own Express server,

```js
const app = require('express')()
const { docker } = require('@stencila/dockta')

const app = express()
app.use('/docker', docker)
app.listen(3000)
```
