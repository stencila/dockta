Docker is a useful tool for creating reproducible computing environments. But creating truly reproducible Docker images can be difficult - even if you already know how to write a `Dockerfile`. 

Dockter makes it easier for researchers to create Docker images for their research projects. Dockter generates a `Dockerfile` and builds a image, for _your_ project, based on _your_ source code.

> 🦄 Dockter is in early development. Features that are not yet implemented are indicated by unicorn emoji. Usually they have a link next to them, like this 🦄 [#2](https://github.com/stencila/dockter/issues/2), indicating the relevant issue where you can help make the feature a reality. It's [readme driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) with calls to action to chase after mythical vaporware creatures! So hip.

## Features

### Builds a Docker image for your project sources

Dockter scans your project folder and builds a Docker image for it. If the the folder already has a `Dockerfile`, Dockter will build the image from that. If not, Dockter will scan the source code files in the folder and generate one for you. Dockter currently handles R and Python source code (with Node.js support planned). A project can have a mix of these languages.

#### R

If the folder contains a R package [`DESCRIPTION`](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html) file then Dockter will install the R packages listed under `Imports` into the image. e.g.

```
Package: myrproject
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2017-10-01
Imports:
   ggplot2
```

The `Package` and `Version` fields are required in a `DESCRIPTION` file. The `Date` field is used to define which CRAN snapshot to use. MRAN daily snapshots began [2014-09-08](https://cran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2014-09-08) so the date should be on or after that.

If the folder does not contain a `DESCRIPTION` file then Dockter will scan all the R files (files with the extension `.R` or `.Rmd`) in the folder for package import or usage statements, like `library(package)` and `package::function()`, and create a `.DESCRIPTION` file for you.

Dockter checks if any of your dependencies (or dependencies of dependencies, or dependencies of...) requires system packages (e.g. `libxml-dev`) and installs those too. No more trial and error of build, fail, add dependency, repeat... cycles!

#### Python

If the folder contains a [`requirements.txt`](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html) file, or a 🦄 [#4](https://github.com/stencila/dockter/issues/4) [`Pipfile`](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile), Dockter will copy it into the Docker image and use `pip` to install the specified packages.

If the folder does not contain either of those files then Dockter will 🦄 [#5](https://github.com/stencila/dockter/issues/5) scan all the folder's `.py` files for `import` statements and create a `.requirements.txt` file for you.

#### Node.js

If the folder contains a 🦄 [#7](https://github.com/stencila/dockter/issues/7) [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file, Dockter will copy it into the Docker image and use `npm` to install the specified packages.

If the folder does not contain a `package.json` file, Dockter will 🦄 [#8](https://github.com/stencila/dockter/issues/8) scan all the folder's `.js` files for `import` or `require` statements and create a `.package.json` file for you.

#### Jupyter

If the folder contains any 🦄 [#9](https://github.com/stencila/dockter/issues/9) `.ipynb` files, Dockter will scan the code cells in those files for any Python `import` or R `library` statements and extract a list of package dependencies. It will also  🦄 [#10](https://github.com/stencila/dockter/issues/10) add Jupyter to the built Docker image.


### Quicker re-installation of language packages

If you have built a Docker image you'll know that it can be frustrating waiting for *all* your project's dependencies to reinstall when you simply add or remove one of them.

The reason this happens is that, due to Docker's layered filesystem, when you update a requirements file, Docker throws away all the subsequent layers - including the one where you previously installed your dependencies. That means that all those packages need to get reinstalled.

Dockter takes a different approach. It leaves the installation of language packages to the language package managers: Python's [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) , Node.js's `npm`, and R's `install.packages`. These package managers are good at the job they were designed for - to check which packages need to be updated and to only update them. The result is much faster rebuilds, especially for R packages, which often involve compilation.

Dockter does this by looking for a special `# dockter` comment in a `Dockerfile`. Instead of throwing away layers, it executes all instructions after this comment in the same layer - thus reusing packages that were previously installed.

#### An example

Here's a simple motivating [example](fixtures/tests/py-pandas). It's a Python project with a `requirements.txt` file which specifies that the project depends upon `pandas` which, to ensure reproducibility, is pinned to version `0.23.0`,

```
pandas==0.23.0
```

The project also has a `Dockerfile` which specifies which Python version we want to use, copies `requirements.txt` into the image, and uses `pip` to install the packages:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7.0

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can build a Docker image for that project using Docker,

```bash
docker build .
```

Docker will download the base Python image (if you don't yet have it), download five packages (`pandas` and it's four dependencies) and install them. This took over 9 minutes when we ran it.

Now, let's say that we want to get the latest version of `pandas` and increment the version in the `requirements.txt` file,

```
pandas==0.23.1
```

When we do `docker build .` again to update the image, Docker notices that the `requirements.txt` file has changed and so throws away that layer and all subsequent ones. This means that it will download and install *all* the necessary packages again, including the ones that we previously installed. For a more contrived illustration of this, simply add a space to one of the lines in the `requirements.txt` file and notice how the package install gets repeated all over again.

Now, let's add a special `# dockter` comment to the Dockerfile before the `COPY` directive,

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7.0

# dockter

COPY requirements.xt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The comment is ignored by Docker but tells `dockter` to run all subsequent instructions in a single filesystem layer,

```bash
dockter build .
```

Now, if you change the `requirements.txt` file, instead of reinstalling everything again, `pip` will only reinstall what it needs to - the updated `pandas` version. The output looks like:

```
Step 1/1 : FROM python:3.7.0

```


### Generates structured meta-data for your project

Dockter uses [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) as it's internal data structure. When it parses your project's source code it generates a JSON-LD tree using a vocabularies from [schema.org](https://schema.org) and [CodeMeta](https://codemeta.github.io/index.html).

For example, It will parse a `Dockerfile` into a schema.org [`SoftwareSourceCode`](https://schema.org/SoftwareSourceCode) node extracting meta-data about the Dockerfile. 

Dockter also fetches meta data on your project's dependencies, which could be used to generate a complete software citation for your project.

```json
{
  "name": "myproject",
  "datePublished": "2017-10-19",
  "description": "Regression analysis for my data",
  "softwareRequirements": [
    {
      "description": "\nFunctions to Accompany J. Fox and S. Weisberg,\nAn R Companion to Applied Regression, Third Edition, Sage, in press.",
      "name": "car",
      "urls": [
        "https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/car/",
        "https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=car",
        "http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/index.html"
      ],
      "authors": [
        {
          "name": "John Fox",
          "familyNames": [
            "Fox"
          ],
          "givenNames": [
            "John"
          ]
        },
```

### Easy to pick up, easy to throw away

Dockter is designed to make it easier to get started creating Docker images for your project. But it's also designed not to get in your way or restrict you from using bare Docker. You can easily, and individually, override any of the steps that Dockter takes to build an image. 

- *Code analysis*: To stop Dockter doing code analysis and take over specifying your project's package dependencies, just remove the leading '.' from the `.DESCRIPTION`, `.requirements.txt` or `.package.json` file that Dockter generates. 

- *Dockerfile generation*: Dockter aims to generate readable Dockerfiles that conform to best practices. They include comments on what each section does and are a good way to start learning how to write your own Dockerfiles. To stop Dockter generating a `.Dockerfile`, and start editing it yourself, just rename it to `Dockerfile`.

- *Image build*: Dockter manage builds use a special comment in the `Dockerfile`, so you can stop using Dockter altogether and build the same image using Docker (it will just take longer if you change you project dependencies).


## Install

Dockter is available as pre-compiled, standalone command line tool (CLI), or as a Node.js package. In both cases, if you want to use Dockter to build Docker images, you will need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) if you don't already have it.

### CLI

#### Windows

To install the latest release of the `dockter` command line tool, download `dockter-win-x64.zip` for the [latest release](https://github.com/stencila/dockter/releases/) and place it somewhere on your `PATH`.

#### MacOS

To install the latest release of the `dockter` command line tool to `/usr/local/bin` just,

```bash
curl -L https://unpkg.com/@stencila/dockter/install-latest-macos.sh | sudo bash
```

Or, if you'd prefer to do things manually, download `dockter-macos-x64.tar.gz` for the [latest release](https://github.com/stencila/dockter/releases/) and then,

```bash
tar xvf dockter-macos-x64.tar.gz
sudo mv -f dockter /usr/local/bin
```

#### Linux

To install the latest release of the `dockter` command line tool to `~/.local/bin/` just,

```bash
curl -L https://unpkg.com/@stencila/dockter/install-latest-linux.sh | bash
```

Or, if you'd prefer to do things manually, or place Dockter elewhere, download `dockter-linux-x64.tar.gz` for the [latest release](https://github.com/stencila/dockter/releases/) and then,

```bash
tar xvf dockter-linux-x64.tar.gz
mv -f dockter ~/.local/bin/ # or wherever you like
```

### Package

If you want to integrate Dockter into another application or package, it is also available as a Node.js package :

```bash
npm install @stencila/dockter
```

## Use

The command line tool has three primary commands `compile`, `build` and `execute`. To get an overview of the commands available use the `--help` option i.e.

```bash
dockter --help
```

To get more detailed help on a particular command, also include the command name e.g

```bash
dockter compile --help
```

### Compile a project

The `compile` command compiles a project folder into a specification of a software environment. It scans the folder for source code and package requirement files, parses them, and creates an `.environ.jsonld` file. This file contains the information needed to build a Docker image for your project.

For example, let's say your project folder has a single R file, `main.R` which uses the R package `lubridate` to print out the current time:

```R
lubridate::now()
```

Let's compile that project and inspect the compiled software environment. Change into the project directory and run the `compile` command.

```bash
dockter compile
```

You should find three new files in the folder created by Dockter:

- `.DESCRIPTION`: A R package description file containing a list of the R packages required and other meta-data

- `.envrion.jsonld`: A JSON-LD document containing structure meta-data on your project and all of its dependencies

- `.Dockerfile`: A `Dockerfile` generated from `.environ.jsonld`


### Build a Docker image

Usually, you'll compile and build a Docker image for your project in one step using the `build` command. This command runs the `compile` command and builds a Docker image from the generated `.Dockerfile` (or  handwritten `Dockerfile`):

```bash
dockter build
```

After the image has finished building you should have a new docker image on your machine, called `rdate`:

```bash
> docker images
REPOSITORY        TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
rdate             latest              545aa877bd8d        About a minute ago   766MB
```

### Execute a Docker image

You can use Docker to run the created image. Or use Dockter's `execute` command to compile, build and run your image in one step:

```bash
> dockter execute
2018-10-23 00:58:39
```

There are several other projects that create Docker images from source code and/or requirements files including:

- [`alibaba/derrick`](https://github.com/alibaba/derrick)
- [`jupyter/repo2docker`](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker)
- [`Gueils/whales`](https://github.com/Gueils/whales)
- [`o2r-project/containerit`](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit)
- [`openshift/source-to-image`](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image)
- [`ViDA-NYU/reprozip`](https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/reprozip])

Dockter is similar to `repo2docker`, `containerit`, and `reprozip` in that it is aimed at researchers doing data analysis (and supports R) whereas most other tools are aimed at software developers (and don't support R). Dockter differs to these projects principally in that it:

- performs static code analysis for multiple languages to determine package requirements (🦄 well, right now just R).

- uses package databases to determine package system dependencies and generate linked meta-data (`containerit` does this for R).

- quicker installation of language package dependencies (which can be useful during research projects where dependencies often change).

- by default, but optionally, installs Stencila packages so that Stencila client interfaces can execute code in the container.

`reprozip` and its extension `reprounzip-docker` may be a better choice if you want to share your existing local environment as a Docker image with someone else.

`containerit` might suit you better if you only need support for R and don't want managed packaged installation

`repo2docker` is likely to be better choice if you want to run Jupyter notebooks or RStudio in your container and don't need source code scanning to detect your requirements 

If you don't want to build a Docker image and just want a tool that helps determining the package dependencies of your source code check out:

## FAQ

*Why go to the effort of generating a JSON-LD intermediate representation instead of writing a Dockerfile directly?*

Having an intermediate representation of the software environment allows this data to be used for other purposes (e.g. software citations, publishing, archiving). It also allows us to reuse much of this code for build targets other than Docker (e.g. Nix) and sources other than code files (e.g. a GUI). 

*Why is Dockter a Node.js package?*

We've implemented this as a Node.js package for easier integration into Stencila's Node.js based desktop and cloud deployments.

*Why is Dockter implemented in Typescript?*

We chose Typescript because it's type-checking and type-annotations reduce the number of runtime errors and improves developer experience.

*I'd love to help out! Where do I start?*

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (OK, so this isn't asked *that* frequently. But it's worth a try eh :woman_shrugging:.)
